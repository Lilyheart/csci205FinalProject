In your main project folder, include a readme.txt file that provides a very brief statement of your project, including the team name, members of the team, and a couple of paragraphs summarizing what this project is. Include any important details to ensure the we can easily compile and execute your program. Please include directions to run your program using the jar file. We should not need to spend lots of time trying to determine what files are in your folder for each phase due date. Clearly indicate which Java file contains the main program (and, your main method should always be in a Java file located in the root source folder, and not in a package.)
